tonight I added jc s tiles
I also did some editing of the vaiorus ease and speed vairalbales
I also added some new variables for the robot
such as:
chase_consistency_upper_limit - this controls where in the code it said 
chase_consistency <= 10 // new var replaces 10, this allows for better adjusting

same with speedyItem, where in the code it used to just assign hero.speed = 380, 
I changed it to hero.speed = speedyItem.speed , 
I also added a "shot" var that keeps track of how many times the boss gets shot,
also have a boolean that is used in a few places for loading the boss graphic. 

NEXT STEPS:

LEVEL 1 - screen 0 appears to be missing a tile, not sure what happened there.
ADJUST ITEMS AND ROBOTS IN LEVEL 1,2,3 
shanes last screen drops the player to screen 34, so JC's old 16 and 17 should get
moved or something. I think we should add just one or two more screens (possibly none)
to level 3, and place the boss at the final screen, make sure player has speedyItem 
and taser.
